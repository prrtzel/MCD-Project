env variables:

makefile builds as follows:
    - C is compiled with vbccm68k (32bit) using the amiga softfloat lib for floating point values
    - the object file is then compiled to assembly for readability
    - this is then linked with an assembly header file
    - final object is converted to s-record
    - the s-record is opened with batch file to easy68k sim

notes:
    .L debugging files currently not supported 
    time spent:

# TODO
- add if define for simulator vs hardware
- figure out how to put all strings into header file
- implement malloc
- add exceptions for read mem
- cleanup code

# Morg the Monitor Program
Morg needs to:
    1. read from memory
    2. write to memory
    3. read from a register
    4. write to a register
    5. load an s-record
    6. run an s-record

To select an option select the number and press enter

# Reading From Memory (1)
Ex: Read Address 0x6969
'6969' ascii hex to binary for each byte
shift each byte in word
final result is 0x6969
ptr = 0x6969

data = *ptr
convert data into ascii
output ascii
