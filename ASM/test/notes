makefile builds as follows:
    - C is compiled with vbccm68k (32bit) using the amiga softfloat lib for floating point values
    - the object file is then compiled to assembly for readability
    - this is then linked with an assembly header file
    - final object is converted to s-record
    - the s-record is opened with batch file to easy68k sim
