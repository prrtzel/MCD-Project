Where variables are placed:

.rodata
const char str[] = "holy moly batman!!";

.bss
static int var;

.data
int var = definition;


Commands for Morg:

help - help page

rm - read memory location
dmp - dump memory region
wm - write to a memory location

rr - read register
wr - write to register

ld - load an srecord
run - run the srecord








OK SO
IT WILL WRITE TO MEMORY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE


memory is still a bit wack, making conversions so that we can debug that
